TODO:

- Figure out how to access instance of FSI.exe process, and use stuff related to SetCompletionFunction
	- Figure out how interactive service is started
	- See if I can find reference through fsi var in console

- Build remoting autocomplete service which is started from FSI window and exposing autocomplete methods
